# TikTok Fake Coins Recharge Page

## A page that simulates the recharge of TikTok accounts. The coins are fake, that is, it is used only to simulate that you are recharging coins into someone's account.

### This is a method used to "steal" coins in livestreams on TikTok, it has probably already appeared on Fy. In which they promise to multiply someone's coins. For example, someone sends you a gift worth 100 points and they promise to give you 1000 in return.
